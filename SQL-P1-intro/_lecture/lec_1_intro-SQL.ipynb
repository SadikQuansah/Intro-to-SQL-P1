    "# Introduction to SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) stands for Structured Query Language (you can pronounce it as 'sequel' or 'ess-cue-elle'). It allows you to retrieve data stored in relational databases and manipulate it in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a concept of a database is new to you, you can think of it as a collection of tables. For instance, you can draw a comparison to an Excel workbook with multiple worksheets where each worksheet is somehow related to another. Worksheets in this comparison are SQL tables and the entire workbook would be a database. The key is to have some sort of relationship between the tables that allows you to bring all that data together (this is just an analogy and Excel workbook is not a database!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table in SQL consists of rows and columns where columns represent different data attributes and rows represent observations or data records. Tables can contain different types of data but the main types are integer, decimal, character or string, date, and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many DB systems available like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, MS SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, etc. However, all of them speak SQL, so once you've got the hang of the basic SQL syntax you'll be able to work with any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we will be using a database system called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html) to practice SQL syntax.\n",
    "Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary files on your computer. A complete SQL database with multiple tables, etc., is contained in a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SQL is the main database language used worldwide, there are plenty of resources to master it:\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT is the most important command as it allows you to retrieve data from a table. SELECT on itself won't do anything, so you need to specify what data you want to retrieve and from where.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can retrieve data from a table, so you need to specify a table name in the SELECT statement. SELECT statement refers to the columns part of a table and not the rows, so you also need to list columns. Here are a few things to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To select a column, you will simply need to type its name\n",
    "- You can select all columns by typing their name or you can use * to select all columns without typing their names\n",
    "- You can select as many or as few columns from a table as you want\n",
    "- You can even create new columns in the SELECT statement\n",
    "\n",
